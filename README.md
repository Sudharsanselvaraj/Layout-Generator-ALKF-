# Automated Layout Generator with Constraints

## Overview
This project implements an automated layout generation system for placing buildings on a fixed rectangular site while satisfying a set of geometric and relational constraints. The goal is to explore multiple valid spatial configurations programmatically and visualize them clearly.

The solution is designed as a constrained spatial optimization problem using random search and scoring to generate, evaluate, and rank building layouts.

## Problem Description

### Site Configuration
- Site size: 200 m × 140 m rectangular plot
- Coordinate system: Cartesian (0, 0) to (200, 140)

### Building Types
- Tower A (Primary): 30 m × 20 m footprint
- Tower B (Secondary): 20 m × 20 m footprint

### Central Plaza
- Size: 40 m × 40 m
- Located near the center of the site
- No building is allowed to overlap this plaza

---

## Constraints Implemented

The following constraints are enforced during layout generation:

1. All buildings must be fully inside the site boundaries.
2. A minimum distance of 15 m (edge-to-edge) is maintained between any two buildings.
3. A minimum setback of 10 m is maintained from the site boundary.
4. Neighbour-mix rule:
   - For every Tower A, at least one Tower B must be located within 60 m.
5. Central plaza rule:
   - Building footprints must not overlap the central plaza.

All constraints are checked geometrically using rectangle-based distance and overlap calculations.

## Approach

The system uses a random search–based optimization strategy:

- Buildings are placed incrementally at random valid positions.
- Partial geometric constraints are checked during placement to avoid invalid configurations.
- Global relational constraints (neighbour-mix rule) are checked after a full layout is generated.
- A scoring function evaluates valid layouts based on:
  - Number of buildings (density)
  - Total built-up area
  - Proximity between Tower A and Tower B
  - Compactness of the layout
- Multiple layouts are generated and ranked, and the top layouts are visualized.

This approach allows efficient exploration of many layout configurations while maintaining correctness.

## Output Visualizations

The generated layouts are visualized using architectural-style plots that include:
- Site boundary
- Central plaza with dimensions
- Building footprints with labels
- Grid for scale reference
- Legend and statistics panel

Below are sample outputs generated by the system.

### Layout 1

### Layout 2

### Layout 3

Each layout displays:
- Number of Tower A and Tower B buildings
- Total built area
- Layout score
- Clear visual verification of constraint satisfaction
